# Readable API Server

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.
Users can post content to predefined categories, make comments on the posts, and vote on the posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

To run this project locally:

* Install and start the API server
  * `cd api-server`
  * `npm install`
  * `node server`
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
  * `cd my-app`
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
